What is CSS-in-Js? What challenges it poses to developers? But before we get started let's not forget that CSS is awesome, and itâ€™s easy to get started with.
So why we need to write CSS in Javascript and how to do it.

CSS-in-JS bridges the gap between CSS and JavaScript, it doesn't meant to destroy everything you love about CSS. My opinion is, it can make authoring CSS far more enjoyable, and I'd encourage you to give it a shot.

## Why CSS-in-JS

Web applications have been scaling at a massive and complex rate, and they are Javascript heavy, just look at React ecosystem.
You can still write regular CSS, you can use CSS Preprocessor like SASS, you can use CSS Modules etc. All these methodolgies are sufficient in styling your React applications.
These methodolgies works perfect when you have to work on static site like marketing website, microsite or small projects.

CSS-in-JS goes one step ahead and solve numerous problems which above methodolgies can pose in developing dynamic web applications. It eliminates problems such as:
  * Global namespace
  * Style dependencies
  * Dead code elimination
  * Composition of styles
  * Sharing constants

## How it works

CSS-in-JS is an approach where styles are written in JavaScript instead of in external CSS files to easily scope styles in components, eliminate dead code, encourage faster performance and dynamic styling, and more.

Here are key features:
  - CSS-in-JS allows you to write CSS in JavaScript syntax
  - It takes advantage of native JS syntax features
  - Colocate styles with components
